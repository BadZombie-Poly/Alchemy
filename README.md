	DISCLAIMER: This is my first attempt at a mod, so may appear rough around the edges.
	
	ABOUT ==========
	This mod adds consumable buffs into the game.
	
	The buffs are consumed in the form of a potion which are either found or crafted at the Alchemy Station.
	
	In order to craft a potion you need to spec into Alchemy, found under Intelligence in the perk tree, or read the relevant recipe.
	
	The crafting ingredients for potions get progressively more difficult to find as the potions scale.
	
	Searching "_AM" in the creative menu will bring up all new items added by this mod.
	
	Have fun and thanks for trying out the mod!

	Ideas for future updates (any help appreciated)

	- wandering potion trader using the screamer model as a base

	- catch zombies to harvest infected flesh. Use special narcotic ammo to get a 'captured zombie' block
	which can be placed and grows like a crop - model is a radiated zombie in a cage

	- clothing items with buffs
